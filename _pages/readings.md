# Book Recommendations:
These recommendations are not about the best prose nor about the most interesting story; they're about books to build a foundation on which will help you stabalize your life to get where you would like to go in some form of comfort.

1. **How to Read a Book: The Classic Guide to Intelligent Reading**

Serial entrepreneur Mike Michalowicz has developed a behavioral approach to accounting to flip the formula: Sales - Profit = Expenses.
