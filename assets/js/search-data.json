            "content": "Post Void is a hypnotic scramble of early first-person shooter design that values speed above all else. Keep your head full and reach the end; Kill what you can to see it mend; Get the high score or try again.” . About a month ago I Steam was kind enough to recommend a rough looking LSD-inspired shooter. And, this little gem is called Post Void created by a little Developer group called YCJY Games. Looking at the videos, screenshots and description I was immediately sold: . “Post Void is a hypnotic scramble of early first-person shooter design that values speed above all else. Keep your head full and reach the end; Kill what you can to see it mend; Get the high score or try again.” . . The game delivers on all of that with the classic Arcade Shooter style that I miss everytime I spin up any modern First Person Shooter and with a price tag of $2.99, there wasn’t any risk. . There is a tutorial level to get you acquainted with the basic ideas of the game - which is really just: You have a slide like many modern shooters. Your health is that glass tiki skull which drains away. Then you’re dropped right in and good luck. . The management of your health which forces you to press on creates a fun stresser which is simple but not overwhelming to manage: kill to fill. The enemy varieties are also limited for the 11 stages you race through - which isn’t all that many. It’s not a long game and wouldn’t actually mind seeing a Post Void 2 which pulls some elements from Rouge-likes and maybe a bit of coop shuffle. Also, the aim is a bit forgiving and there were moments where I was sure I would miss but still killed an enemy. . The art style is a bit rough on the eyes at first but actually is the right choice to make registering enemies and threats blend into the background just enough that you can miss or run right into them if you’re not careful. I’m also partial to colorful games so I admit this visually is my kind of game. . All in all, I’d recommend stuffing this game into downtime between lobbies and breaks between studying to stay alert. . Also, the Shotgun is best. Who knows why anyone wants to use the knife: weirdos. .",

            "title": "Game Review: Empyrion - Galactic Survival",
            "content": "Game Review: Empyrion - Galactic Survival . If you’re looking for a TL:DR: game is fun but has some challenges. . The first time I opened the map to see all the different systems we could visit I was basically sold on the game. The first time we made our system hop, we almost got trapped in hellscape and had a blast trying to get off that planet. . Empyrion - Galactic Survival is - well - a Survival Game that adds the idea of different planets and systems to explore instead of simply other towns or woods or whatever that splotch over that hill is. What’s nice about it was as you explore the menus, it gives you something to plan for while trying to build up some semblance of safety where you are. As you scroll out, there are hundreds of systems to explore with their own rings of planets and moons and asteroid fields - which really is the allure of this game. I want to float around the Galaxy and do stupid things. . Out of the gate, there are lots of geometries to play with when building bases or anything else which is a nice change from other Survival games where you’re kind of stuck with a few pre-defined structures. Sadly, the internal structure of the actual block shape wont impact where you can actually place anything since you’re still locked into a cubic construction system. This does make a good number of the more interesting shapes rather impractical to try and use on anything you build. . The plethora of pieces to care about makes navigating and management challenging. Finding out just how to build your first actual base was annoying until you realize that you need a core or a starter block to build off anything. Different blocks are tied to different kinds of structures which are denoted by the initials HV,CV,SV,BA which are just not explained. You’re going to be reading the descriptions of the stuff you build; you’re going to have to just about all the time because you’re going to miss important details. My mistake was not realizing that shields will require a Pentaxid to fuel them and there is no warning about this until the shields don’t work - except the last line in the text. A better idea maybe would have been that you don’t have any shields until you’ve actually fed your Vessel Pentaxid and therefore you’ll be forced to realize this. There is a good amount of finding out the hard way. . Likewise, there are lots of small stats and management that goes into a base which make sense but just don’t feel intuitive at all. I know that I need power and to do that I need something which makes power but I don’t know anything about Solar Panel rates from looking at the device before construction; there is no real way to optimize buildings or make decisions about if I want something until I’ve made it and realized that I either don’t need it yet or it’s missing necessary components. The Solar Panels need a Capacitor else they’re really not much use once the sun is down - and the base doesn’t store anything. Explore the Control Panel as soon as you can. . Contrary to some complaints, the combat isn’t bad for a Survival game and fights in space have been pretty fun. Having my friend float around in a tuned Small Vessel hecking out resources in Zirax controlled space to avoid pulling us into a space fight with our starter Capital Vessel only to be discovered by a wandering drone led to quite the episode of us coordinating his docking while everything in the system came to murder us escaping with a queue’d up lock to a different system for just such an emergency is why this game has been fun. The complaints about being outgunned are certainly true though. The Defense Station that sits just outside the atmosphere is a space graveyard of failed attempts to kick it out of the orbit. After building a prototype to try and kill the thing, I point-blanked it with 6 pulse Lasers 49 times before it finally blew apart my small vessel and I lost. The AI for the enemies in the game is certainly questionable too. I’ve watched as three factions of different types mingle with one another as if they’re not even aware of each other until I am taking shots at them and then they’re all after me like there is some pact to murder non-NPCs in the Galaxy on sight. . All in all, I’m not regretting buying it and it’s probably my favorite current Survival game. I think that the criticisms are pretty fair though; the game is very ambitious and they haven’t delivered yet but the platform is there so long as they’re continuing to diligently add the pieces patch by patch I’ll keep playing it. Complicated but promising. .",

            "title": "A Post Exploring Altair",
            "content": "This Is The Tool We Have . I&#39;m trying out the fastpages in hopes that I wont have to spend the time building out my own website toolset. I&#39;ve been slowly building something out of Wagtail which is a really just Djnago with some bells. The real allure though is going to be the Notebook conversions - specifically the Data Visualizations. The library for interactive version is Altair and we&#39;re going to explore some data! . Lets Explore! . So, the tutorial for Scatter Plot uses the car data but I figured we mind as well do the classic Iris dataset. We&#39;ll start by importing the dataset from vega_datasets - which is the Javascript library that Altair is built on top of - using iris = data.iris(). . iris = data.iris() iris . sepalLength sepalWidth petalLength petalWidth species . 0 5.1 | 3.5 | 1.4 | 0.2 | setosa | . 1 4.9 | 3.0 | 1.4 | 0.2 | setosa | . 2 4.7 | 3.2 | 1.3 | 0.2 | setosa | . 3 4.6 | 3.1 | 1.5 | 0.2 | setosa | . 4 5.0 | 3.6 | 1.4 | 0.2 | setosa | . ... ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | . 145 6.7 | 3.0 | 5.2 | 2.3 | virginica | . 146 6.3 | 2.5 | 5.0 | 1.9 | virginica | . 147 6.5 | 3.0 | 5.2 | 2.0 | virginica | . 148 6.2 | 3.4 | 5.4 | 2.3 | virginica | . 149 5.9 | 3.0 | 5.1 | 1.8 | virginica | . 150 rows × 5 columns . First lets see the graph - and then we&#39;ll discuss the functions . alt .Chart(iris) .mark_point() .encode( x=&#39;sepalLength&#39;, y=&#39;sepalWidth&#39;, color=&#39;species&#39;, tooltip = [&#39;species&#39;, &#39;petalLength&#39;, &#39;petalWidth&#39;] ) .interactive() . It is interesting to note that - per the Docs - : . Create a basic Altair/Vega-Lite chart. . Although it is possible to set all Chart properties as constructor attributes, it is more idiomatic to use methods such as mark_point(), encode(), transform_filter(), properties(), etc. . .. which means that it&#39;s found a way to do something similar to the R Programming Languages pipe operator. For reference, it would looks something like this:mtcars %&gt;% ggplot(aes(wt, mpg)) + geom_point(aes(colour = factor(cyl))) . . First we tell altair to make a chart using the dataset we&#39;re using: . .Chart(iris) . ... which is then followed by the kind of graph that we&#39;re after - in this case we&#39;re after a scatter plot: . .mark_point() . ... and then we tell it where everything belongs. . .encode( x=&#39;sepalLength&#39;, y=&#39;sepalWidth&#39;, color=&#39;species&#39;, tooltip = [&#39;species&#39;, &#39;petalLength&#39;, &#39;petalWidth&#39;] ) . Of interest is that you can add data from the other columns easily using the tooltip without having to add anything extra. Layering information which is relevant but lacks a meaningful graphic representation was a nice touch. . Then of course, you allow users to interact with it via: . .interactive() . Lets see what this post looks like on the blog! .",

We join the introduced protagonist - Andrew Dalatent - entering a mining colony called New Gibralter where he appears tasked with figuring out what happened to the people there. And, I say it appears because as he starts his descent you find out he’s more aware of the whys and whats of the situation than is initially let on. . Coupled with his own supernatural ability to observe future and past versions of events around him, we get to join him as he tries to survive against humanity removed of its own free will. These sections that Stewart uses were my own personal favorite because they’re surprisingly easy to follow but also because they grow slowly out of being just a novel tactic Andrew uses to protect himself into an important aspect of the later story. . Short read but enjoyable. .",
