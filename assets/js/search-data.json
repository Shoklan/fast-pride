            "content": "How did the challenges go? . The honest truth is that I what I wanted to get done this year was pretty fluid and I did not get many of the commits done. Looking at what I have been working on though - and what I ended up spending my time on - I didn’t do so bad this year. . Firstly, I finally got a macro workflow that is working for pushing my projects forward along with learning new topics. One of the problems which I have been struggling with is how to both learn enough new concepts and frameworks along with actually using them. The normal process being used it to . Find something of interest. | See what’s been made in it. | Work on tutorials, docs for the framework/tool/information. | Try to apply it to pet projects. | Maybe use it in a real project. | This process has problems that I needed solved. Since I have my hands in multiple different places - Data Science, Linux, Programming, Web Design, Secret Project I can’t discuss yet, etc - then this simply doesn’t work. With my life growing in so many dimensions, I simply cannot sit down and follow this process for a single framework and then maybe add it to what I am working on. If it takes a month or two to apply and become comfortable with the framework then it’s too slow and the other aspects of my life will end up neglected. So, what do I do now? . I have split the months of the year up into four quarters - just like a a business calendar. Then, the first month of that quarter is a Learning Month which means I review what I need to learn, allocate out a set of classes for the month and then do power through them in that month. I take notes about what I’m learning and for some parts will actually practice with a very small pet project which is meant to implement a single thing. After that month is over, the next two months are Apply Months which means that I take everything that I learned in that month, review it, and then start adding it to my projects. . This allows me to schedule up to four of classes covering any material I might need coming up in the next few months. This is also better because it keeps learning and application separate. When my schedule was fluid I kept finding ways to not work on projects since I constantly fell back into learning about new frameworks and tools. Now, the clear separation is allowing me to be strict about when and what tasks are supposed to be done. It is already paying out dividends – even though the first attempt at it I was sick for most of the first month of Apply. . Read 100 Books . Of all the challenges that I wanted to complete, this is the one. And, I did worse than last year too: 81 books last year vs 31 books this year. Looking over how my life has changed since the Pandemic started, I think the biggest reason is that much of my reading was done in between. If I was waiting in line at a store then I was reading; while walking from the parking garage at work into the office I was reading. Now that we’re remote only and there are no lines when I am out running errands, I just don’t really read books as much as I used to. I do listen to them while walking around stores but often I don’t count those in the totals; I finished all of the Dragonlance Chronicles books via Audible for example and they’re not filled out on Goodreads. This means setting up time at home to read and I’m always working on projects or doing chores or watching lecture videos. That really only leaves downtime at work to read and we’ve been relatively busy lately. And, I happen to also have projects for Datto that I work on so that’s not really in the cards either. I’ll have a separate post to what the Challenges of 2022 are going to be so strategies will be discussed in that post. . Create Three Potential Streams of Income . For this one, I was successful. Currently, I have two streams of income: one active (Datto) and one semi-passive (Crypto) to work with. I am making money in both of those realms at this point which was more than I had set for the goal. The goal was to identify three potential streams of income that I could have for the year and there was no shortage of ideas for this one. I’ll discuss some of my favorites in the real Challenges of 2022 post but there are plenty more than three, . New Job Title . This is was a failed challenge. After exploring and talking with lots of people, this is going to be the hardest one. And, you’d consider that since I already have so many useful skills that it would be the easiest but it’s simply not. Realistically, I like where I work and I don’t really want to leave any time soon. All the positions that are within reach are jobs that I simply don’t want. And, I am not willing to trade in the job I have for those other jobs since they’d change something fundamental about what I want: working overnights, well limiting interacting with users, flexible time table for my own work. I’ll discuss more details in the Challenges of 2022 post when I write it. . A Blog Post a Month . This is another place that I did decent but did not hold myself too. The biggest factor for this was simply not setting aside the time for it. It’s lower on the list of priorities which need to get done so I simply didn’t schedule out the time. Along side that was anything I wanted to write about I didn’t feel either qualified to write about or didn’t feel what I was willing to write would be be long or interesting enough to justify the post. This is a mindset problem which I should be able to easily solve in the coming year. Especially after looking at what the average person on Medium is writing about; they’re not even trying to write quality content most of the time but instead are simply writing very short not-even-tutorial posts about how to use a framework. There is also a surprising amount of “X Ideas fro Passive Income” posts which are mostly all the same thing over and over. I can do better than that. . Draw an Original Comic . I dropped this one entirely – and I’m dropping it for next year too. I have a list of Daily Tasks which include things like exercise, typing practice along with drawing practice and by far the task I skip the most is drawing. I need to change this so I can actually start drawing at an ok level. Right now, I am struggling with curved lines and that’s quite basic for this level of challenge. I have a few ideas – when don’t I? - but this is a long road which I need to build basic habits out before even trying some kind of real challenge like a Comic. .",

            "content": "Read 50 Books . I’m lowering the number back to 50 books even though 100 books is still the larger goal. The real reason is I need to find a way to fit reading back into my schedule. With so many projects, I will be shifting to audiobooks which is depressing since I read faster than I can process audiobooks. I do have a trick for this: listen to ebooks via the Kindle Store in a Web Browser. This is probably a good enough place to explain how this works. . Install an extension for your Web Browswer which does Text-To-Speech - such as Read Aloud. Honestly, finding a quaility Text-to-Speech reader and paying for the extension is a better idea than free; the lack of intonation from the extension I am using makes listening much harder. Concentrating is harder compared to a professionally done book from Audible. Go to Your Online Kindle Library and find a book to listen to. Open the book up and then hit the play button inside your Text-To-Speech extension. You will need to adjust the speed, voice, volume and location when you hit play per new book for tuning. But, this is a good way to fit more average fiction reading into your day. . Putting this in the background of the first half of my work shift sounds correct. Since I am not usually interacting with people then it should be an easy way to get 2-3 hours of “reading” done each day. Let the challenge begin. . Have Three Streams of Income . We’re moving from planning to application with this one. . Primary “9-5” Job. . Obviously, my job is the primary source of income - and I have no real interest in changing that. Working Technicaly Support is usually an awful experience since you’re dealing with End Users which have no real understanding of technology nor how their behaviors make little sense. However, where I work I am dealing with people that at least have some background in technology so having conversations with them is usually much less painful than End Users. Since my role is also on Overnights, this significantly limits the interactions with the kinds of people who constantly cause problems for themselves - and therefore me. . Streaming . I’m going to take a serious attempt at making money on Content Creation sites like Youtube, Twitch and TikTok. The competition here is enormous and this is not the kind of job I admit I’m naturally good at but it fits well into my life. I play games with my friends and coworkers consistenly enough that these can be put online without too much trouble. Getting people to watch or care about the content is a totally different problem. Doing the research that I have so far, we’re really going to have to lean on Personality quite a bit otherwise this simply wont work. Due to being on Linux, there really is nothing but Splitgate which I can play competitively and stream. And looking at the numbers, Splitgate is struggling both as a streamed game as well as keeping an audiance of players: ![images/2022-challenges/splitgate-numbers.png] ![images/2022-challenges/splitgate-twitch.png] . So, maybe I could try and niche with Splitgate but I would be concerned with getting locked into playing a game struggling to grow. To start though, I will need: . To become Affiliate on Twitch. | Get better at tags on Youtube. | To start posting shorts to Tik Tok. | Web Design . This is the least fun option but I’m capable of this. I have found a set of frameworks and a niche that I can work in without getting too far dragged into the larger frameworks: Single Page Websites. As I expand my ability to use tools such as Blender, Inkscape then I can push into more artistic and aesthetic styles instead of the more normal Single Page Sites. Not much else to say aside from if this works out then expect a Portfolio coming soon. . Logo Design . Between slowly expanding Blender skills and working on my drawing skills, this would be something fun that I could doodle designs and then try to sell to others. There is quite a bit about communicating concepts artistically along with a good amount of Color Theory to learn before I can do this. . Crypto . This is already my second source of income and I’m already positive. Pushing for Six Figures in Crypto this year. . New Job Title . This year is the real year that matters though for my job; I have a patent pending for the company and this should be year I get the nay/yay for whether it goes through. No matter how that goes, I’m pushing for an Analytics Job either inside or outside the company. I am familiar enough and competent enough to be doing this as a real job and I am well bored of doing Technical Support. It also is not a real future for me; there is no where to go that I want to be. So, if by six months in I don’t see any progress here then I’m going to start applying for part time Analytics jobs to build experience and push into a new career. . 36 Blog Posts For the Year. . I have been spending a good amount of time reading Medium posts and articles by others this year. And, my expectations are far too high and totally unnecessary. While in college, I learned about one of the books that significanly changed my expecations about writing: The Elements of Style by Strunk and White. The book emphasis is always on Omit Needless Words and I extended that to all of my writing since then: write only what needs to be said. While a good guide, this is now preventing me from writing at all. If someone else has said it then I am not writing about it; if someone hasn’t written about it then I am not confident in writing about it. I know enough and am learning enough to write content to clarify my thoughts for myself and others. So, three posts per month on anything I feel like: Game Design, Data Science, etc . Make the Secret Project Public . By the end of the year, there will be public posts about this project. Watch for a reveal in the future. .",

            "title": "Monthly Game Review: Ethereal Estate",
            "content": ". I had quite a bit of fun with this game. While working on a Data Science project to try and make predictions on “What Genre Is this Game Based on it’s Header Image?” I stumbled across this weird little game trying to solve an error. Looking through the sample set of games, Ethereal Estate pops out among all the other DLC headers and who knows what else these other images are supposed to inspire. The game is free and you play as a ghost - along with maybe your friend - to terrorize, ruin and throw everything within reach around: like a proper ghost should! . Anyways, the trailer is simple but hilarious so good work Emergence Studio for getting my attention and pulling me in. Your ghost experience is a shopping list of mayhem courtesy of the designer where you cross all kinds of lines: lighting things on fire, throwing people through windows, ramming things with swords, stuff people in closets, poisoning food, breaking records, bringing your victoms back to murder them again, etc. The game is surprising smooth and simple - and fun. My friend and I found the list a bit unclear while roaming around throwing people through windows; my favorite activity in the whole game. I just hope there are more levels coming since there is only the one and we cleared it without too much trouble. Maybe a more traditional graveyard? .",

            "title": "Game Review: The Forest",
            "content": "The Forest is another game in the Survival Genre which tries to use Environmental Storytelling to push a plot. You can play with your friends or you can play alone - which definitely gives you a different experience. Alone - so I’m told - feels a lot lot a horror game where you’ll fear leaving the walls of whatever you’ve built. With friends, it was good fun but definitely doesn’t feel like a horror game: FREE BONES! . We’ll start with the stuff I didn’t like first. Like most survival games there is crafting for shelters, walls, defenses and cooking. Unlike most other survival games that I’ve played, crafting buildings in this one feels pretty pointless. There are about four buildings that actually matter: Drying Rack, Bonfire, Water Collector, Shelter. Anything that produces light barely matters and you have to constantly feed fuel to the fires to get the initial “overburn” to really see in the darkness - or really far at all. . Walls are fun but we built on an island off the coast of the main island so we basically just started building random stuff for fun since our base never got attacked. Which is real unfortunate because this game has one of the best building systems I’ve ever played with. The buildings are cumulative so you can build what is basically a blueprint that your friends can collectively dump resources into. And, everyone can see them and since there is a visual blueprint you can actually lay out your base “Blueprint” in full for discussion. What a great idea! . Since it’s Environmental Storytelling, you can basically skip all of it until the end while murdering everything along the way. This is what happened to us - we ended up running into the caves to wipe out the natives and just kind of picked up whatever we found - on our way to kill more of the natives. This isn’t really the game’s fault but more the way we played so beware of missing stuff until the end when you have no choice but to address the story that you don’t really understand. . The combat is surprisingly fun and one the better Combat systems in a Survival Game. Ranged weapons are not broken and do not nullify enemies into a shooting range and melee feels really good with trading blows with the Cannibals. This isn’t really due to the system being complicated but much more about how well done the animations and the interactions with the Natives themselves: they flee, they try to kind of spook and intimidate you, they call their friends. Enemy and animal variety was pretty good and you get introduced to newer enemies at the right times - at least for us. Learn how to block; you’re going to need it. . I mentioned the Night above but it’s really a positive: when it’s dark it is fucking dark. Wandering around at night can get you lost really fast. Everything moving around you - leaves, trees, animals - will making you constantly on edge thinking about if you’re about to get attacked in the dark. Following enemies in the dark is just hard so you wont know how many there are nor where they ran of to. Running around in the Forest really does feel like moving around in the woods stumbling onto deer and opposing murderhobos while you try and find a stable water supply. . A few annoyances around multiplayer we ran into where one time we died and my friend had to afk to do something else. And, I got stuck in the plane behind him for a full hour - not game time, real life time - since it was impossible to actually get around him to play the game. . Another is that the server doesn’t actually save the state. You must save your own character at shelters otherwise you lose progress. This makes absolutely no sense at all when we’re playing on a server being hosted by someone else. You will lose progress if you don’t personally constantly save. . Another was that since we were all doing our own tasks and split up often, some of us didn’t end up having all the tools necessary to get to the end of the game. As a five-man group, one of us got stuck behind because of this while we basically tried to finish the game. If you do this then the bad news is that you all have to vote at the end otherwise you can’t finish the game. We ended up just watching the endings on Youtube after doing all the work to get to the end. . Also, game works in Linux completely in Proton 6.3-4. .",

            "title": "Credit Card Security",
            "content": "How Secure is a Credit Card? . Everyone is worried about having their credit card information stolen at some point. We all trust the banks to ensure nobody can just guess our number and submit orders in our name. But, did you know math is the secret behind your security? There are four main issues with stealing a credit card: . Getting the Credit Card Number | Getting the Security Code | Getting the Expiration Date | Getting your Personal Details | Getting the Credit Card Number . There are a total of 10000000000000000 total numbers that can exist for a credit card number. The odds, therefore, to get your number is 1:10000000000000000. But, it’s worse than that because the entire collection of numbers are not used to generate credit cards. In fact, credit cards can pass or fail passed on something called Luhn’s Algorithm This algorithm is used to create what is called a subgroup inside of the total number of cards. We don’t want criminals to just guess numbers and accidentally hit anyone. This is formula is a first line of defense to ensure fake numbers cannot be submitted. . ALGORITHM_CONSTANT = 9 def confirmLuhn(number): #==== Luhn&#39;s Algo ========================== count = 0 # Sum all numbers excluding the last number. sum = 0 # For every other number, square it. # Compare the last digit of the CC number for digit in number: # against the last digit of the sum. num = int(digit) if count == 15: # If final digit, return (sum *ALGORITHM_CONSTANT %10 == num) # compare final digits. elif count % 2 == 1: # If off number, sum += num*num # square number. count +=1 else: # If not off number, sum += num # just add the number to the sum count += 1 #=========================================== outfile = open(&quot;CCNumbers.txt&quot;, &#39;w&#39;) # File opening, obviously. # First we generate the number space that we&#39;re testing. for x in range(0, 0000000000000100): # The real CC number space is actually [0, 9999999999999999], but that&#39;s too much. xString = &quot;%.16d&quot; % x # This is probably lazy design, but I want to fill out the space of numbers and keep the 0&#39;s if confirmLuhn(xString): outfile.write(xString+&quot;n&quot;) # If it&#39;s one of them, then write the result to the file. outfile.close() # BILLIONS OF YEARS OF WORK AND YOU FORGOT TO CLOSE THE STORAGE FILE IN THE CODE?!? . I wrote a basic CC number finder that uses a very small space of numbers to check against as existing numbers - and, you can find it herefor those wishing to pull it and build on it. . Getting the Security Code . The probability of getting the 3 digit number on the back of that card is 1:1000. That might not seem like a lot, and it’s not, but without that number you can’t use the card online. And, most banks will lock your card after a few failed tries. If I can see and memorize the 16 digit Credit Card number from seeing once - this isn’t all that hard, it just takes a bit of practice - this 1:1000 probability is what keeps them from using it online without your consent. . Let’s assume that I did memorize your number and I’m trying to figure out what that code is. Most banks I know of will lock a hard after 5 failed attempts. That means I have a 5:1000 or 1:200 chance of guessing right before the card number becomes useless. Of course, that’s completely ignoring if I don’t have the number and am just trying to guess everything. Even if I beat the 1:10000000000000000 chance of picking the right number and it passes the Luhn Algorithm then I still need to guess with a 1:1000 chance of getting the right number within each potential number. But, it gets even worse for me. . Getting the Expiration Date . I still have to get past your expiration date. There really is no good way to know the actual probability since banks can use any number of years before the card expires. But, I’ll assume a larger case to overestimate since banks will make the task as hard as possible. Let’s guess that the range of expiration dates is from 2000 - 2030 since some cards are in the wild. We’re looking at a 1:360 chance - which is really tiny when you compare it to other probability spaces. But, we need to think about the entire probability space of 1:10000000000000000 * 1:200 * 1:360 just to find the right card. To select the right card data of just you is 1:720,000,000,000,000,000,000. For comparison, that’s about 6 multiples large than the estimated total of every human being ever alive. . But, what if I memorized all of this information? . Getting your Personal Details . Even after selecting the right credit card with the right security code and the right expiration date you still need to know the precise living address of the person you’re trying to attack to submit orders online. No wonder credit card scammers steal them with skimmers or fake online bank pages! Math wins. .",

A Memorandum of Understanding primarily serves as a point of negotiation between two or more parties with respect to their intents.

Special consideration should be paid to whether the document is Legally binding in the legal context it is being used; these are normally not legally binding.

And the reason for this is rather obvious if you’ve every tried mixing building Web Applications with Data Exporation or Reporting for other people inside your company - or just in general for your projects. . We’re going to build a little Web App with the Iris dataset. And yes, please don’t groan; I am also sick of the Iris dataset but it’s clean and simple and accessible. . So, first we start with actually downloading and it’s just their namesake: . python -m pip install streamlit . Next we’ll import and scaffold off their introduction application: . import streamlit as st # To make things easier later, we&#39;re also importing numpy and pandas for # working with sample data. import numpy as np import pandas as pd st.text(&quot;Hello World&quot;) . … and save that to a file called irisExplore.py. Once that’s done, you’ll run it from the console using streamlit run irisExplore.py: . And there we have our first Web Application. Calling the HTML elements that you want and expect is just that simple. If you want a paragraph then you’ll use st.title(): . st.title(&quot;Turtles Turtles Turtles&quot;) st.subheader(&quot;But, which movie reference is it?&quot;) st.text(&quot;Hello World&quot;) . And, there is even support for Latex too!: . st.title(&quot;Turtles Turtles Turtles&quot;) st.subheader(&quot;But, which movie reference is it?&quot;) st.text(&quot;Hello World&quot;) st.latex(r&#39;&#39;&#39; a + ar + a r^2 + a r^3 + cdots + a r^{n-1} = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ar^k = a left( frac{1-r^{n}}{1-r} right) &#39;&#39;&#39;) . . Now with Data! . So, now we’re going to take a quick look at how to add charts. First we’re going to collect the iris dataset. If you have R or something like Tensorflow installed then you can import it from there. I’m going to collect it from someone random on the internet. You should probably download this dataset and store it somewhere; you’ll never get away from it. . import pandas as pd iris = pd.read_csv(&quot;https://datahub.io/machine-learning/iris/r/iris.csv&quot;) . Adding the chart is just as easy and you would expect: . st.line_chart(iris) . Not exactly what we’re looking but it’s kind of neat. This should serve as a reminder that when it comes to tools, it’s Garbage In, Garbage Out for what you feed it. Be careful what you’re doing because our tools wont know any better. .",

I have script that does all of this but we&#39;re going to go over it so you understand each part and then I&#39;ll attach the bash script at the end. To start with, we&#39;re going to need Java since Spark is dependent on it. Login to each host - Master and Slaves - and you&#39;ll want to run: . apt update &amp;&amp; apt install openjdk-8-jre openjdk-8-jdk -y . Remember to adjust this for own Linux Distribution. . Figure out which directory you want to install Apache Spark into; Normally, you&#39;d use /opt so that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to be using. Download the archive of the files from the website: . wget -O /opt/spark-2.4.6-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz https://downloads.apache.org/spark/spark-2.4.6/spark-2.4.6-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz . If they obsolete the download link then you can find the versions online here. I&#39;m using the 3.0.1 version Pre-built for Apache Hadoop 2.7 for this but feel free to experiment. Once the file is downloaded, you&#39;ll want to unpack the archive: . tar -xzvf /opt/spark-2.4.6-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz -C /opt rm /opt/spark-2.4.6-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz . Now you&#39;ll have files ready for usage. Next you&#39;ll want to add the environmental variables so that linux will know where to look for the binary when you call it: . echo -e &quot; nexport SPARK_HOME=/opt/spark-2.4.6-bin-hadoop2.7 nexport PATH=/opt/spark-2.4.6-bin-hadoop2.7/bin:$PATH&quot; | tee -a ~/.bashrc export SPARK_HOME=/opt/spark-2.4.6-bin-hadoop2.7 export PATH=/opt/spark-2.4.6-bin-hadoop2.7/bin . Do this for all the hosts that you&#39;ll need to run Spark on. . Configuration Files . It is best to create a master copy of these next few configuratoin files to copy to each host in turn. This way you only need to edit each file ones and then copy them all the the appropriate hosts . For your master server, you&#39;ll need to update two files: spark-defaults.conf and spark-env.sh. Both of these should be found inside the conf directory of your spark home. Make sure you make a backup of them before you do anything else: . cp spark-defaults.conf spark-defaults.conf.bkp cp spark-env.sh spark-env.sh.bkp . Next you&#39;ll want to open them and add the master info information. For the defaults file simple uncomment and modify the line to look like: . spark.master spark://&lt;host or IP Addr&gt;:7077 . ... and the env file you&#39;ll want to look for the line: . SPARK_MASTER_HOST=&#39;&lt;host of IP Addr&gt;&#39; . You shouldn&#39;t need to change anything else in this file so long as you have full control of the systems you&#39;re using. In my case, I happen to not and changed where shuffle and worker logs are ran to avoid the operating system from filling up and crashing the host. If you need to worrry about those then update the lines SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS, SPARK_WORKER_DIR and SPARK_PID_DIR to point to somewhere else on the system which wont fill up the partition. . Next you&#39;ll want to collect the names or IP addresses of all the hosts in your cluster and add them to the slaves file in config directory just like were the others are. Make sure to test the connectivity of your hosts using ping or something else to confirm they can actually talk to one another! . Datastore . Now we&#39;re going to work around not having a Hadoop cluster. How this works, is that we&#39;re going to create a shared folder on all of the hosts which references the Master as the Source of Truth. First, create a folder in your spark home to hold the data: . mdkir $SPARK_HOME/Data . Go ahead and create a file in here for future usage: touch turtles . Next you&#39;ll go ahead and install a package called sshfs which is used to remotely mount a folder from one host and another: . sudo apt install sshfs . Repeat this for all the hosts in your cluster. Once that is done, you&#39;ll connect the slaves to the master using: . sshfs &lt;username&gt;@&lt;master-address&gt;:/opt/spark-2.4.6-bin-hadoop2.7/Data /opt/spark-2.4.6-bin-hadoop2.7/Data . Now you should be able to see the turtles file we created earlier if you list the files in the Data directory . ls Data . If you see the file then feel free to move on! If not, then double back and troubleshoot the connection between those two computers. Could also be permissions or something like that as well! . Connect the Dots, Start the Services . Now that we&#39;ve got it all connected together, go ahead and run the appropriate commands on the masters and servers to start them all up: . # master: $SPARK_HOME/sbin/start-master.sh # slaves: $SPARK_HOME/sbin/start-slave.sh spark://&lt;master-Addr&gt;:7077 . Success! . Now try and run it on the master: . username@HOST:~# $SPARK_HOME/bin/pyspark Python 2.7.12 (default, Apr 15 2020, 17:07:12) [GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux2 Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information. 20/10/13 05:19:50 WARN Utils: Your hostname, HOST.localdomain resolves to a loopback address: 127.0.0.1; using &lt;address&gt; instead (on interface eth0) 20/10/13 05:19:50 WARN Utils: Set SPARK_LOCAL_IP if you need to bind to another address 20/10/13 05:19:50 WARN NativeCodeLoader: Unable to load native-hadoop library for your platform... using builtin-java classes where applicable Using Spark&#39;s default log4j profile: org/apache/spark/log4j-defaults.properties Setting default log level to &quot;WARN&quot;.

That should give you the above. . Now you can transfer data into that directory and read from it using the spark.read.* function that you need. Note that copying Big Data into that directory is not a good idea. If you&#39;re looking at TeraBytes or Petabytes worth of data then you&#39;ll definitely need a real Cluster. But, I&#39;ve already made some interesting observations in this limited environment. .",

With 52 weeks in the year, this means I will need to read 1.92 books per week. If I’m going to have a break day from everything - on Sundays - then that usually means reading about 100-134 pages of the current novel per day. Doing this along with being productive and pursuing larger goals gets it onto my list. . Create Three Potential Streams of Income. . I wont be discussing what those are but if modern society and the current state of affairs has taught me anything it’s to be proactive. You don’t want to be responding to a loss after it’s happened; you want to have responded before it has happened. Always have a plan B - and maybe a C. If you need your computer to work, then you’ll want a fallback that can throw in as a substitute. With working from home, the first thing I did was check to see if I can use my phone as a substitute for if my ISP decides to do “maintenance.” It works by the way. I wont hold myself to actually generating an income yet but that’s a stretch goal for the year. . New Job Title . I’m bored of being a Senior at this point and either need some larger technical challenges or just a swap in the set of responsibilities I deal with on a daily basis.

You’ll want to keep coming back an skimming over the table of contents months after you read it just to ensure you’re still folling the advice. Sometimes you’ll be doing things right; sometimes you’re far off the mark. . Establish a Creative Process . The core idea of the book is know what you want, plan how to get there and then execute it - without excuses. Like most advise, it sounds easy until you have to start making changes in your life. David goes over pit falls to avoid while on the way; some he’s walked into himself. That doesn’t just mean “do what your told” either. From the text: . Your process and your goals should align. The chief way in which you will evaluate the efficacy of your process is by judging how well it moves you forward towards you goals. A process that doesn’t deliver sufficient outputs, or delivers outputs other than those which are desired, must be revised.” . Be active about monitoring your own process for faults. For years, I would take online classes and feel that I wasn’t making any progres towards my goal of being a Data Scientist. Even know I recognized the topics and ideas in videos and articles, I never felt like was moving anywhere. Then, I did the work of starting to document all the classes I finished - was working on; or planned to work on - to find that I was actually making lots of progress in most of the important subjects necessary. This has now lead me to the next hurdle in the process: Application. I’ve redesign my methods and attention to build more and play more with the ideas I see in classes. In effect, watching lectures allows one to know more than others but not show anything for it. Which false into another part from the text: . “Practice zombies are focusing on doing things that are easy, rather than things that are hard - things which will move them forward and create growth.” . Watching online lectures is easy; building projects to show others is hard. While I have some projects to show, they are far fewer than how much I want to have built. .",

            "title": "Simple Introduction to Python Debugging",
            "content": "Inspiration . While working on a script that I’m writing for work, I was having trouble really tracking down where my logic was failing. After looking over the code, everything looked correct but the results were showing me otherwise. So, I opened up python’s debugging system and started to dig in. . What is Debugging? . In computer programming and software development, debugging is the process of finding and resolving bugs (defects or problems that prevent correct operation) within computer programs, software, or systems. cf: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging . There are plenty of tools to do stuff like this but Python comes with its own: pdb — The Python Debugger. To activate it, you’d simply go into your terminal and type: . user@station# python3 -m pdb &lt;script-name&gt; . This with start the script from the top and immediately stop before running anything: . user@station:/scripts# python3 -m pdb keyIntegrityCheck.py &gt; /scripts/keyIntegrityCheck.py(5)&lt;module&gt;() -&gt; from pathlib import Path (Pdb) . While this is useful, we need to be able to explore the file. You could keep an editor open on a different monitor and move around but sometimes that’s not going to be an option. To print all the lines in the file you’d use: . (Pdb) ll 1 #!/usr/bin/env python3 2 ## Author: Collin Mitchell 3 ## Purpose: To check the integrity of keys without user input. 4 5 -&gt; from pathlib import Path 6 from itertools import filterfalse 7 import subprocess as sp 8 import json 9 import sys # ... 370 integrityFunc = dd.get(str(filename).split(&#39;.&#39;)[-1]) 371 if integrityFunc: 372 consistent = integrityFunc( filename ) 373 if not consistent: print(&quot;{} is not consistent.&quot;.format(filename)) 374 else: 375 print(&quot;{} is missing a checker; please report {} so it can be added.&quot;.format(filename,filename)) (Pdb) . You can see the pointer on line five telling us where the current execution point is. We can move the pointer a single line using n: . (Pdb) n [336/1995] &gt; /scripts/keyIntegrityCheck.py(6)&lt;module&gt;() -&gt; from itertools import filterfalse (Pdb) ll 1 #!/usr/bin/env python3 2 ## Author: Collin Mitchell 3 ## Purpose: To check the integrity of keys without user input. 4 5 from pathlib import Path 6 -&gt; from itertools import filterfalse 7 import subprocess as sp 8 import json 9 import sys . You can see the next 11 lines in the console buffer using l: . (Pdb) l 1 #!/usr/bin/env python3 2 ## Author: Collin Mitchell 3 ## Purpose: To check the integrity of keys without user input. 4 5 from pathlib import Path 6 -&gt; from itertools import filterfalse 7 import subprocess as sp 8 import json 9 import sys 10 11 # stuff to do with phpserialize: (Pdb) . Not that if you do this and run it again that you wont get the same result: . (Pdb) l 12 import codecs 13 try: 14 codecs.lookup_error(&#39;surrogateescape&#39;) 15 default_errors = &#39;surrogateescape&#39; 16 except LookupError: 17 default_errors = &#39;strict&#39; 18 try: 19 xrange 20 except NameError: 21 xrange = range 22 try: (Pdb) . … but you will get the next 11 lines instead. You can tell it which lines to list centered on a line number using l 10: . (Pdb) l 10 5 from pathlib import Path 6 -&gt; from itertools import filterfalse 7 import subprocess as sp 8 import json 9 import sys 10 11 # stuff to do with phpserialize: 12 import codecs 13 try: 14 codecs.lookup_error(&#39;surrogateescape&#39;) 15 default_errors = &#39;surrogateescape&#39; (Pdb) . Now that we can move around, let’s discuss how to actually stop code execution using breakpoints. These are locations you set - sometimes with conditions - to stop the code execution and explore the current state. You can set these using ‘b’: . (Pdb) b (Pdb) . Since we don’t have any breakpoints set, then it makes sense we don’t see any listed. So, now lets set one: . (Pdb) b 9 Breakpoint 1 at /scripts/keyIntegrityCheck.py:9 (Pdb) . … and continue execution until the breakpoint using c: . (Pdb) c &gt; /scripts/keyIntegrityCheck.py(9)&lt;module&gt;() -&gt; import sys (Pdb) . … and list the active breakpoints again: . (Pdb) b Num Type Disp Enb Where 1 breakpoint keep yes at /scripts/keyIntegrityCheck.py:9 breakpoint already hit 1 time (Pdb) . You can clear that breakpoint using the number of the breakpoint as well: . (Pdb) b Num Type Disp Enb Where 1 breakpoint keep yes at /scripts/keyIntegrityCheck.py:9 breakpoint already hit 1 time (Pdb) cl 1 Deleted breakpoint 1 at /scripts/keyIntegrityCheck.py:9 (Pdb) b (Pdb) . Conditional breakpoints I found a bit tricky to get to work correctly because you need to place a comma after the statement: . (Pdb) b 371, integrityFunc.__name__ == &#39;integrityPhp&#39; Breakpoint 3 at /scripts/keyIntegrityCheck.py:371 (Pdb) . … and then you c until it triggers: . &gt; /scripts/keyIntegrityCheck.py(371)&lt;module&gt;() -&gt; if integrityFunc: (Pdb) integrityFunc &lt;function integrityPhp at 0x7f99291477b8&gt; (Pdb) . Conclusion . I couldn’t find much outside of the official documentation when I needed it so hopefully you find the highlights useful. There are also tools for whichever IDE you’re using so look out for those as well. .",

            "content": "Post Void is a hypnotic scramble of early first-person shooter design that values speed above all else. Keep your head full and reach the end; Kill what you can to see it mend; Get the high score or try again.” . About a month ago I Steam was kind enough to recommend a rough looking LSD-inspired shooter. And, this little gem is called Post Void created by a little Developer group called YCJY Games. Looking at the videos, screenshots and description I was immediately sold: . “Post Void is a hypnotic scramble of early first-person shooter design that values speed above all else. Keep your head full and reach the end; Kill what you can to see it mend; Get the high score or try again.” . . The game delivers on all of that with the classic Arcade Shooter style that I miss everytime I spin up any modern First Person Shooter and with a price tag of $2.99, there wasn’t any risk. . There is a tutorial level to get you acquainted with the basic ideas of the game - which is really just: You have a slide like many modern shooters. Your health is that glass tiki skull which drains away. Then you’re dropped right in and good luck. . The management of your health which forces you to press on creates a fun stresser which is simple but not overwhelming to manage: kill to fill. The enemy varieties are also limited for the 11 stages you race through - which isn’t all that many. It’s not a long game and wouldn’t actually mind seeing a Post Void 2 which pulls some elements from Rouge-likes and maybe a bit of coop shuffle. Also, the aim is a bit forgiving and there were moments where I was sure I would miss but still killed an enemy. . The art style is a bit rough on the eyes at first but actually is the right choice to make registering enemies and threats blend into the background just enough that you can miss or run right into them if you’re not careful. I’m also partial to colorful games so I admit this visually is my kind of game. . All in all, I’d recommend stuffing this game into downtime between lobbies and breaks between studying to stay alert. . Also, the Shotgun is best. Who knows why anyone wants to use the knife: weirdos. .",

            "title": "Game Review: Empyrion - Galactic Survival",
            "content": "If you’re looking for a TL:DR: game is fun but has some challenges. . The first time I opened the map to see all the different systems we could visit I was basically sold on the game. The first time we made our system hop, we almost got trapped in hellscape and had a blast trying to get off that planet. . Empyrion - Galactic Survival is - well - a Survival Game that adds the idea of different planets and systems to explore instead of simply other towns or woods or whatever that splotch over that hill is. What’s nice about it was as you explore the menus, it gives you something to plan for while trying to build up some semblance of safety where you are. As you scroll out, there are hundreds of systems to explore with their own rings of planets and moons and asteroid fields - which really is the allure of this game. I want to float around the Galaxy and do stupid things. . Out of the gate, there are lots of geometries to play with when building bases or anything else which is a nice change from other Survival games where you’re kind of stuck with a few pre-defined structures. Sadly, the internal structure of the actual block shape wont impact where you can actually place anything since you’re still locked into a cubic construction system. This does make a good number of the more interesting shapes rather impractical to try and use on anything you build. . The plethora of pieces to care about makes navigating and management challenging. Finding out just how to build your first actual base was annoying until you realize that you need a core or a starter block to build off anything. Different blocks are tied to different kinds of structures which are denoted by the initials HV,CV,SV,BA which are just not explained. You’re going to be reading the descriptions of the stuff you build; you’re going to have to just about all the time because you’re going to miss important details. My mistake was not realizing that shields will require a Pentaxid to fuel them and there is no warning about this until the shields don’t work - except the last line in the text. A better idea maybe would have been that you don’t have any shields until you’ve actually fed your Vessel Pentaxid and therefore you’ll be forced to realize this. There is a good amount of finding out the hard way. . Likewise, there are lots of small stats and management that goes into a base which make sense but just don’t feel intuitive at all. I know that I need power and to do that I need something which makes power but I don’t know anything about Solar Panel rates from looking at the device before construction; there is no real way to optimize buildings or make decisions about if I want something until I’ve made it and realized that I either don’t need it yet or it’s missing necessary components. The Solar Panels need a Capacitor else they’re really not much use once the sun is down - and the base doesn’t store anything. Explore the Control Panel as soon as you can. . Contrary to some complaints, the combat isn’t bad for a Survival game and fights in space have been pretty fun. Having my friend float around in a tuned Small Vessel hecking out resources in Zirax controlled space to avoid pulling us into a space fight with our starter Capital Vessel only to be discovered by a wandering drone led to quite the episode of us coordinating his docking while everything in the system came to murder us escaping with a queue’d up lock to a different system for just such an emergency is why this game has been fun. The complaints about being outgunned are certainly true though. The Defense Station that sits just outside the atmosphere is a space graveyard of failed attempts to kick it out of the orbit. After building a prototype to try and kill the thing, I point-blanked it with 6 pulse Lasers 49 times before it finally blew apart my small vessel and I lost. The AI for the enemies in the game is certainly questionable too. I’ve watched as three factions of different types mingle with one another as if they’re not even aware of each other until I am taking shots at them and then they’re all after me like there is some pact to murder non-NPCs in the Galaxy on sight. . All in all, I’m not regretting buying it and it’s probably my favorite current Survival game. I think that the criticisms are pretty fair though; the game is very ambitious and they haven’t delivered yet but the platform is there so long as they’re continuing to diligently add the pieces patch by patch I’ll keep playing it. Complicated but promising. .",

            "title": "A Post Exploring Altair",
            "content": "This Is The Tool We Have . I&#39;m trying out the fastpages in hopes that I wont have to spend the time building out my own website toolset. I&#39;ve been slowly building something out of Wagtail which is a really just Djnago with some bells. The real allure though is going to be the Notebook conversions - specifically the Data Visualizations. The library for interactive version is Altair and we&#39;re going to explore some data! . Lets Explore! . So, the tutorial for Scatter Plot uses the car data but I figured we mind as well do the classic Iris dataset. We&#39;ll start by importing the dataset from vega_datasets - which is the Javascript library that Altair is built on top of - using iris = data.iris(). . iris = data.iris() iris . sepalLength sepalWidth petalLength petalWidth species . 0 5.1 | 3.5 | 1.4 | 0.2 | setosa | . 1 4.9 | 3.0 | 1.4 | 0.2 | setosa | . 2 4.7 | 3.2 | 1.3 | 0.2 | setosa | . 3 4.6 | 3.1 | 1.5 | 0.2 | setosa | . 4 5.0 | 3.6 | 1.4 | 0.2 | setosa | . ... ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | . 145 6.7 | 3.0 | 5.2 | 2.3 | virginica | . 146 6.3 | 2.5 | 5.0 | 1.9 | virginica | . 147 6.5 | 3.0 | 5.2 | 2.0 | virginica | . 148 6.2 | 3.4 | 5.4 | 2.3 | virginica | . 149 5.9 | 3.0 | 5.1 | 1.8 | virginica | . 150 rows × 5 columns . First lets see the graph - and then we&#39;ll discuss the functions . alt .Chart(iris) .mark_point() .encode( x=&#39;sepalLength&#39;, y=&#39;sepalWidth&#39;, color=&#39;species&#39;, tooltip = [&#39;species&#39;, &#39;petalLength&#39;, &#39;petalWidth&#39;] ) .interactive() . It is interesting to note that - per the Docs - : . Create a basic Altair/Vega-Lite chart. . Although it is possible to set all Chart properties as constructor attributes, it is more idiomatic to use methods such as mark_point(), encode(), transform_filter(), properties(), etc. . .. which means that it&#39;s found a way to do something similar to the R Programming Languages pipe operator. For reference, it would looks something like this:mtcars %&gt;% ggplot(aes(wt, mpg)) + geom_point(aes(colour = factor(cyl))) . . First we tell altair to make a chart using the dataset we&#39;re using: . .Chart(iris) . ... which is then followed by the kind of graph that we&#39;re after - in this case we&#39;re after a scatter plot: . .mark_point() . ... and then we tell it where everything belongs. . .encode( x=&#39;sepalLength&#39;, y=&#39;sepalWidth&#39;, color=&#39;species&#39;, tooltip = [&#39;species&#39;, &#39;petalLength&#39;, &#39;petalWidth&#39;] ) . Of interest is that you can add data from the other columns easily using the tooltip without having to add anything extra. Layering information which is relevant but lacks a meaningful graphic representation was a nice touch. . Then of course, you allow users to interact with it via: . .interactive() . Lets see what this post looks like on the blog! .",

            "content": "The Voices of the Void by David Stewart is a pleasant short story that mixes a Science Fiction backdrop with some supernatural horror. We join the introduced protagonist - Andrew Dalatent - entering a mining colony called New Gibralter where he appears tasked with figuring out what happened to the people there. And, I say it appears because as he starts his descent you find out he’s more aware of the whys and whats of the situation than is initially let on. . Coupled with his own supernatural ability to observe future and past versions of events around him, we get to join him as he tries to survive against humanity removed of its own free will. These sections that Stewart uses were my own personal favorite because they’re surprisingly easy to follow but also because they grow slowly out of being just a novel tactic Andrew uses to protect himself into an important aspect of the later story. . Short read but enjoyable. .",
