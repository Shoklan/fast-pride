&lt;p&gt;The honest truth is that I what I wanted to get done this year was pretty fluid and I did not get many of the commits done. Looking at what I have been working on though - and what I ended up spending my time on - I didn’t do so bad this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I finally got a macro workflow that is working for pushing my projects forward along with learning new topics. One of the problems which I have been struggling with is how to both learn enough new concepts and frameworks along with actually using them. The normal process being used it to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find something of interest.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;See what’s been made in it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work on tutorials, docs for the framework/tool/information.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try to apply it to pet projects.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maybe use it in a real project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process has problems that I needed solved. Since I have my hands in multiple different places - Data Science, Linux, Programming, Web Design, Secret Project I can’t discuss yet, etc - then this simply doesn’t work. With my life growing in so many dimensions, I simply cannot sit down and follow this process for a single framework and then maybe add it to what I am working on. If it takes a month or two to apply and become comfortable with the framework then it’s too slow and the other aspects of my life will end up neglected. So, what do I do now?
	I have split the months of the year up into four quarters - just like a a business calendar. Then, the first month of that quarter is a &lt;strong&gt;Learning Month&lt;/strong&gt; which means I review what I need to learn, allocate out a set of classes for the month and then do power through them in that month. I take notes about what I’m learning and for some parts will actually practice with a very small pet project which is meant to implement a single thing. After that month is over, the next two months are &lt;strong&gt;Apply Months&lt;/strong&gt; which means that I take everything that I learned in that month, review it, and then start adding it to my projects.
	This allows me to schedule up to four of classes covering any material I might need coming up in the next few months. This is also better because it keeps learning and application separate. When my schedule was fluid I kept finding ways to not work on projects since I constantly fell back into learning about new frameworks and tools. Now, the clear separation is allowing me to be strict about when and what tasks are supposed to be done. It is already paying out dividends – even though the first attempt at it I was sick for most of the first month of &lt;strong&gt;Apply&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;read-100-books&quot;&gt;Read 100 Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Of all the challenges that I wanted to complete, this is the one. And, I did worse than last year too: 81 books last year vs 31 books this year. Looking over how my life has changed since the Pandemic started, I think the biggest reason is that much of my reading was done in between. If I was waiting in line at a store then I was reading; while walking from the parking garage at work into the office I was reading. Now that we’re remote only and there are no lines when I am out running errands, I just don’t really read books as much as I used to. I do listen to them while walking around stores but often I don’t count those in the totals; I finished all of the Dragonlance Chronicles books via Audible for example and they’re not filled out on Goodreads. This means setting up time at home to read and I’m always working on projects or doing chores or watching lecture videos. That really only leaves downtime at work to read and we’ve been relatively busy lately. And, I happen to also have projects for Datto that I work on so that’s not really in the cards either. I’ll have a separate post to what the Challenges of 2022 are going to be so strategies will be discussed in that post.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-three-potential-streams-of-income&quot;&gt;Create Three Potential Streams of Income&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;For this one, I was successful. Currently, I have two streams of income: one active (Datto) and one semi-passive (Crypto) to work with. I am making money in both of those realms at this point which was more than I had set for the goal. The goal was to identify three potential streams of income that I could have for the year and there was no shortage of ideas for this one. I’ll discuss some of my favorites in the real Challenges of 2022 post but there are plenty more than three,
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-job-title&quot;&gt;New Job Title&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is was a failed challenge.
After exploring and talking with lots of people, this is going to be the hardest one. And, you’d consider that since I already have so many useful skills that it would be the easiest but it’s simply not. Realistically, I like where I work and I don’t really want to leave any time soon. All the positions that are within reach are jobs that I simply don’t want. And, I am not willing to trade in the job I have for those other jobs since they’d change something fundamental about what I want: working overnights, well limiting interacting with users, flexible time table for my own work. I’ll discuss more details in the Challenges of 2022 post when I write it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-blog-post-a-month&quot;&gt;A Blog Post a Month&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;This is another place that I did decent but did not hold myself too. The biggest factor for this was simply not setting aside the time for it. It’s lower on the list of priorities which need to get done so I simply didn’t schedule out the time. Along side that was anything I wanted to write about I didn’t feel either qualified to write about or didn’t feel what I was willing to write would be be long or interesting enough to justify the post. This is a mindset problem which I should be able to easily solve in the coming year. Especially after looking at what the average person on Medium is writing about; they’re not even trying to write quality content most of the time but instead are simply writing very short not-even-tutorial posts about how to use a framework. There is also a surprising amount of “X Ideas fro Passive Income” posts which are mostly all the same thing over and over. I can do better than that.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;draw-an-original-comic&quot;&gt;Draw an Original Comic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dropped this one entirely – and I’m dropping it for next year too.
I have a list of Daily Tasks which include things like exercise, typing practice along with drawing practice and by far the task I skip the most is drawing. I need to change this so I can actually start drawing at an ok level. Right now, I am struggling with curved lines and that’s quite basic for this level of challenge. I have a few ideas – when don’t I? - but this is a long road which I need to build basic habits out before even trying some kind of real challenge like a Comic.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">How did the challenges go?

&lt;p&gt;I had quite a bit of fun with this game.
While working on a Data Science project to try and make predictions on “What Genre Is this Game Based on it’s Header Image?” I stumbled across this weird little game trying to solve an error. Looking through the sample set of games, &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1529470/Ethereal_Estate/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethereal Estate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pops out among all the other DLC headers and who knows what else these other images are supposed to inspire. The game is free and you play as a ghost - along with maybe your friend - to terrorize, ruin and throw everything within reach around: like a proper ghost should!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the trailer is simple but hilarious so good work Emergence Studio for getting my attention and pulling me in.
Your ghost experience is a shopping list of mayhem courtesy of the designer where you cross all kinds of lines: lighting things on fire, throwing people through windows, ramming things with swords, stuff people in closets, poisoning food, breaking records, bringing your victoms back to murder them again, etc. The game is surprising smooth and simple - and fun. My friend and I found the list a bit unclear while roaming around throwing people through windows; my favorite activity in the whole game. I just hope there are more levels coming since there is only the one and we cleared it without too much trouble. Maybe a more traditional graveyard?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Game Review: The Forest</title><link href="https://orgulo.us/games/review/survival/2021/05/18/Game-Review-The-Forest.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Game Review: The Forest" /><published>2021-05-18T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-05-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://orgulo.us/games/review/survival/2021/05/18/Game-Review-The-Forest</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://orgulo.us/games/review/survival/2021/05/18/Game-Review-The-Forest.html">&lt;p&gt;The Forest is another game in the Survival Genre which tries to use Environmental Storytelling to push a plot. You can play with your friends or you can play alone - which definitely gives you a different experience. Alone - so I’m told - feels a lot lot a horror game where you’ll fear leaving the walls of whatever you’ve built. With friends, it was good fun but definitely doesn’t feel like a horror game: FREE BONES!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll start with the stuff I didn’t like first. Like most survival games there is crafting for shelters, walls, defenses and cooking. Unlike most other survival games that I’ve played, crafting buildings in this one feels pretty pointless. There are about four buildings that actually matter: Drying Rack, Bonfire, Water Collector, Shelter. Anything that produces light barely matters and you have to constantly feed fuel to the fires to get the initial “overburn” to really see in the darkness - or really far at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walls are fun but we built on an island off the coast of the main island so we basically just started building random stuff for fun since our base never got attacked. Which is real unfortunate because this game has one of the best building systems I’ve ever played with. The buildings are cumulative  so you can build what is basically a blueprint that your friends can collectively dump resources into. And, everyone can see them and since there is a visual blueprint you can actually lay out your base “Blueprint” in full for discussion. What a great idea!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it’s Environmental Storytelling, you can basically skip all of it until the end while murdering everything along the way. This is what happened to us - we ended up running into the caves to wipe out the natives and just kind of picked up whatever we found - on our way to kill more of the natives. This isn’t really the game’s fault but more the way we played so beware of missing stuff until the end when you have no choice but to address the story that you don’t really understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combat is surprisingly fun and one the better Combat systems in a Survival Game. Ranged weapons are not broken and do not nullify enemies into a shooting range and melee feels really good with trading blows with the Cannibals. This isn’t really due to the system being complicated but much more about how well done the animations and the interactions with the Natives themselves: they flee, they try to kind of spook and intimidate you, they call their friends. Enemy and animal variety was pretty good and you get introduced to newer enemies at the right times - at least for us. Learn how to block; you’re going to need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned the Night above but it’s really a positive: when it’s dark it is fucking dark. Wandering around at night can get you lost really fast. Everything moving around you - leaves, trees, animals - will making you constantly on edge thinking about if you’re about to get attacked in the dark. Following enemies in the dark is just hard so you wont know how many there are nor where they ran of to. Running around in the Forest really does feel like moving around in the woods stumbling onto deer and opposing murderhobos while you try and find a stable water supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few annoyances around multiplayer we ran into where one time we died and my friend had to afk to do something else. And, I got stuck in the plane behind him for a full hour - not game time, real life time - since it was impossible to actually get around him to play the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another is that the server doesn’t actually save the state. You must save your own character at shelters otherwise you lose progress. This makes absolutely no sense at all when we’re playing on a server being hosted by someone else. You will lose progress if you don’t personally constantly save.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another was that since we were all doing our own tasks and split up often, some of us didn’t end up having all the tools necessary to get to the end of the game. As a five-man group, one of us got stuck behind because of this while we basically tried to finish the game. If you do this then the bad news is that you all have to vote at the end otherwise you can’t finish the game. We ended up just watching the endings on Youtube after doing all the work to get to the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, game works in Linux completely in Proton 6.3-4.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The Forest is another game in the Survival Genre which tries to use Environmental Storytelling to push a plot.

&lt;p&gt;Everyone is worried about having their credit card information stolen at some point. We all trust the banks to ensure nobody can just guess our number and submit orders in our name. But, did you know math is the secret behind your security? There are four main issues with stealing a credit card:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Getting the Credit Card Number&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Getting the Security Code&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Getting the Expiration Date&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Getting your Personal Details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-the-credit-card-number&quot;&gt;Getting the Credit Card Number&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a total of 10000000000000000 total numbers that can exist for a credit card number. The odds, therefore, to get your number is 1:10000000000000000. But, it’s worse than that because the entire collection of numbers are not used to generate credit cards. In fact, credit cards can pass or fail passed on something called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm&quot;&gt;Luhn’s Algorithm&lt;/a&gt; This algorithm is used to create what is called a subgroup inside of the total number of cards. We don’t want criminals to just guess numbers and accidentally hit anyone. This is formula is a first line of defense to ensure fake numbers cannot be submitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;outfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;                                               &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# BILLIONS OF YEARS OF WORK AND YOU FORGOT TO CLOSE THE STORAGE FILE IN THE CODE?!?
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a basic CC number finder that uses a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; small space of numbers to check against as existing numbers - and, you can find it &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Shoklan/LuhnAlgorithm&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;for those wishing to pull it and build on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-the-security-code&quot;&gt;Getting the Security Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probability of getting the 3 digit number on the back of that card is 1:1000. That might not seem like a lot, and it’s not, but without that number you can’t use the card online. And, most banks will lock your card after a few failed tries. If I can see and memorize the 16 digit Credit Card number from seeing once - this isn’t all that hard, it just takes a bit of practice - this 1:1000 probability is what keeps them from using it online without your consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume that I did memorize your number and I’m trying to figure out what that code is. Most banks I know of will lock a hard after 5 failed attempts. That means I have a 5:1000 or 1:200 chance of guessing right before the card number becomes useless. Of course, that’s completely ignoring if I don’t have the number and am just trying to guess everything. Even if I beat the 1:10000000000000000 chance of picking the right number &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; it passes the Luhn Algorithm &lt;strong&gt;then&lt;/strong&gt; I still need to guess with a 1:1000 chance of getting the right number within each potential number. But, it gets even &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-the-expiration-date&quot;&gt;Getting the Expiration Date&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have to get past your expiration date. There really is no good way to know the actual probability since banks can use any number of years before the card expires. But, I’ll assume a larger case to overestimate since banks will make the task as hard as possible. Let’s guess that the range of expiration dates is from 2000 - 2030 since some cards are in the wild. We’re looking at a 1:360 chance - which is really tiny when you compare it to other probability spaces. But, we need to think about the entire probability space of 1:10000000000000000 * 1:200 * 1:360 just to find the right card.
To select the right card data of just you is 1:720,000,000,000,000,000,000.
For comparison, that’s about 6 multiples large than the estimated total of every human being ever alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, what if I memorized all of this information?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-your-personal-details&quot;&gt;Getting your Personal Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after selecting the right credit card with the right security code and the right expiration date you &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; need to know the precise living address of the person you’re trying to attack to submit orders online. No wonder credit card scammers steal them with skimmers or fake online bank pages!

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;Memorandum of Understanding&lt;/strong&gt; primarily serves as a point of negotiation between two or more parties with respect to their intents. The document serves as a way to find common ground along with set expectations about what individual parties are both responsible for and expect from the other party. Special consideration should be paid to whether the document is Legally binding in the legal context it is being used; these are normally not legally binding. It is best thought of as similar to a &lt;strong&gt;Gentlemen’s Agreement&lt;/strong&gt;: “an informal and legally non-binding agreement between two or more parties. It is typically oral, but it may be written or simply understood as part of an unspoken agreement by convention or through mutually-beneficial etiquette”[2].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Streamlit is a Framework which is growing in popularity among Python Data Scientists. And the reason for this is rather obvious if you’ve every tried mixing building Web Applications with Data Exporation or Reporting for other people inside your company - or just in general for your projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to build a little Web App with the Iris dataset. And yes, please don’t groan; I am also sick of the Iris dataset but it’s clean and simple and accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, first we start with actually downloading and it’s just their namesake:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;python &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; pip &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;streamlit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we’ll import and scaffold off their introduction application:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;streamlit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;st&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# To make things easier later, we're also importing numpy and pandas for
# working with sample data.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;numpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;st&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello World&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… and save that to a file called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;irisExplore.py&lt;/code&gt;. Once that’s done, you’ll run it from the console using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;streamlit run irisExplore.py&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/intro-to-streamlit/hello-world-streamlit.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hello World Streamlit!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there we have our first Web Application. Calling the HTML elements that you want and expect is just that simple. If you want a paragraph then you’ll use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;st.title()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;st&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Turtles Turtles Turtles&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;st&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subheader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;But, which movie reference is it?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;st&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello World&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/intro-to-streamlit/hello-world-with-titles.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hello World, Now With Titles!&quot; /&gt;
And, there is even support for Latex too!:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;st&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Turtles Turtles Turtles&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;st&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;subheader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;But, which movie reference is it?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;st&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello World&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;st&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;latex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;r'''
    a + ar + a r^2 + a r^3 + \cdots + a r^{n-1} =
    \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ar^k =
    a \left(\frac{1-r^{n}}{1-r}\right)
    '''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/intro-to-streamlit/hello-world-with-latex.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hello World, Now With Latex!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;now-with-data&quot;&gt;Now with Data!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, now we’re going to take a quick look at how to add charts. First we’re going to collect the iris dataset. If you have R or something like Tensorflow installed then you can import it from there. I’m going to collect it from someone random on the internet. You should probably download this dataset and store it somewhere; you’ll never get away from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;iris&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;read_csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://datahub.io/machine-learning/iris/r/iris.csv&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding the chart is just as easy and you would expect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;st&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line_chart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;iris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/intro-to-streamlit/iris-squiggles.png&quot; alt=&quot;Iris Squiggles&quot; /&gt;
Not exactly what we’re looking but it’s kind of neat.
This should serve as a reminder that when it comes to tools, it’s &lt;strong&gt;Garbage In, Garbage Out&lt;/strong&gt; for what you feed it.
Be careful what you’re doing because our tools wont know any better.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">What is Streamlit?

This configuration will be a minimal one using Linux Operating Sytems; I'm going to use Ubuntu so change the install based on your package mananger.
I'm going to assume that you've setup the hosts, their networking and have some way to configure and deploy them. There are options like Puppet or Salt but I'll be avoiding those and leave them up to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

To start with, we're going to need Java since Spark is dependent on it. Login to each host - Master and Slaves - and you'll want to run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;apt update &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; apt install openjdk-8-jre openjdk-8-jdk -y

&lt;p&gt;Remember to adjust this for own Linux Distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure out which directory you want to install Apache Spark into; Normally, you'd use &lt;code&gt;/opt&lt;/code&gt; so that's what we're going to be using. Download the archive of the files from the website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;wget -O /opt/spark-2.4.6-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz https://downloads.apache.org/spark/spark-2.4.6/spark-2.4.6-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they obsolete the download link then you can find the versions online &lt;a href=&quot;https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I'm using the 3.0.1 version Pre-built for Apache Hadoop 2.7 for this but feel free to experiment.
Once the file is downloaded, you'll want to unpack the archive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;tar -xzvf /opt/spark-2.4.6-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz  -C /opt
rm /opt/spark-2.4.6-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you'll have files ready for usage.
Next you'll want to add the environmental variables so that linux will know where to look for the binary when you call it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; -e &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;\nexport SPARK_HOME=/opt/spark-2.4.6-bin-hadoop2.7\nexport PATH=/opt/spark-2.4.6-bin-hadoop2.7/bin:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; tee -a ~/.bashrc
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;SPARK_HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/opt/spark-2.4.6-bin-hadoop2.7
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/opt/spark-2.4.6-bin-hadoop2.7/bin
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do this for all the hosts that you'll need to run Spark on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;Configuration-Files&quot;&gt;Configuration Files&lt;a class=&quot;anchor-link&quot; href=&quot;#Configuration-Files&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is best to create a master copy of these next few configuratoin files to copy to each host in turn.
This way you only need to edit each file ones and then copy them all the the appropriate hosts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For your master server, you'll need to update two files: &lt;code&gt;spark-defaults.conf&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;spark-env.sh&lt;/code&gt;. Both of these should be found inside the &lt;strong&gt;conf&lt;/strong&gt; directory of your spark home.
Make sure you make a backup of them before you do anything else:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;cp spark-defaults.conf spark-defaults.conf.bkp
cp spark-env.sh spark-env.sh.bkp
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next you'll want to open them and add the master info information. For the defaults file simple uncomment and modify the line to look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;spark.master                       spark://&amp;lt;host or IP Addr&amp;gt;:7077&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... and the env file you'll want to look for the line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SPARK_MASTER_HOST='&amp;lt;host of IP Addr&amp;gt;'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shouldn't need to change anything else in this file so long as you have full control of the systems you're using. In my case, I happen to not and changed where shuffle and worker logs are ran to avoid the operating system from filling up and crashing the host. If you need to worrry about those then update the lines &lt;code&gt;SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SPARK_WORKER_DIR&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SPARK_PID_DIR&lt;/code&gt; to point to somewhere else on the system which wont fill up the partition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next you'll want to collect the names or IP addresses of all the hosts in your cluster and add them to the &lt;code&gt;slaves&lt;/code&gt; file in &lt;code&gt;config&lt;/code&gt; directory just like were the others are.
Make sure to test the connectivity of your hosts using &lt;code&gt;ping&lt;/code&gt; or something else to confirm they can actually talk to one another!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Datastore&quot;&gt;Datastore&lt;a class=&quot;anchor-link&quot; href=&quot;#Datastore&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we're going to work around not having a Hadoop cluster. How this works, is that we're going to create a shared folder on all of the hosts which references the Master as the &lt;strong&gt;Source of Truth&lt;/strong&gt;.
First, create a folder in your spark home to hold the data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;mdkir &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$SPARK_HOME&lt;/span&gt;/Data
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and create a file in here for future usage: &lt;code&gt;touch turtles&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next you'll go ahead and install a package called &lt;code&gt;sshfs&lt;/code&gt; which is used to remotely mount a folder from one host and another:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sudo apt install sshfs
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeat this for all the hosts in your cluster. Once that is done, you'll connect the slaves to the master using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sshfs &amp;lt;username&amp;gt;@&amp;lt;master-address&amp;gt;:/opt/spark-2.4.6-bin-hadoop2.7/Data /opt/spark-2.4.6-bin-hadoop2.7/Data
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you should be able to see the &lt;code&gt;turtles&lt;/code&gt; file we created earlier if you list the files in the Data directory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ls Data
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you see the file then feel free to move on! If not, then double back and troubleshoot the connection between those two computers.
Could also be permissions or something like that as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Connect-the-Dots,-Start-the-Services&quot;&gt;Connect the Dots, Start the Services&lt;a class=&quot;anchor-link&quot; href=&quot;#Connect-the-Dots,-Start-the-Services&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we've got it all connected together, go ahead and run the appropriate commands on the masters and servers to start them all up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# master:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$SPARK_HOME&lt;/span&gt;/sbin/start-master.sh

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# slaves:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$SPARK_HOME&lt;/span&gt;/sbin/start-slave.sh spark://&amp;lt;master-Addr&amp;gt;:7077
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Success!&quot;&gt;Success!&lt;a class=&quot;anchor-link&quot; href=&quot;#Success!&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now try and run it on the master:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;username@HOST:~# &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$SPARK_HOME&lt;/span&gt;/bin/pyspark

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should give you the above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inner_cell&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can transfer data into that directory and read from it using the &lt;code&gt;spark.read.*&lt;/code&gt; function that you need.
Note that copying Big Data into that directory is not a good idea. If you're looking at TeraBytes or Petabytes worth of data then you'll definitely need a real Cluster. But, I've already made some interesting observations in this limited environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a challenge because I haven’t done it yet and fitting that many books into my life forces me to think about my spent time.
With 52 weeks in the year, this means I will need to read 1.92 books per week. If I’m going to have a break day from everything - on Sundays - then that usually means reading about 100-134 pages of the current novel per day.
Doing this along with being productive and pursuing larger goals gets it onto my list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-three-potential-streams-of-income&quot;&gt;Create Three Potential Streams of Income.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wont be discussing what those are but if modern society and the current state of affairs has taught me anything it’s to be proactive. You don’t want to be responding to a loss after it’s happened; you want to have responded before it has happened. Always have a plan B - and maybe a C. If you need your computer to work, then you’ll want a fallback that can throw in as a substitute. With working from home, the first thing I did was check to see if I can use my phone as a substitute for if my ISP decides to do “maintenance.” It works by the way.
I wont hold myself to actually generating an income yet but that’s a stretch goal for the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-job-title&quot;&gt;New Job Title&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m bored of being a Senior at this point and either need some larger technical challenges or just a swap in the set of responsibilities I deal with on a daily basis. There are some possibilities which I will try either to create or follow up on but I’m not staying where I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-blog-post-a-month&quot;&gt;A Blog Post a Month.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have this place where I can drop interesting project ideas or discuss problems that I’ve solved for myself to share with others. Since I don’t have a lack of problems to solve, then I should be writing about them for others to read and refer back to. Solving a problem a month is not the challenge but remembering to write about it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;draw-an-original-comic&quot;&gt;Draw An Original Comic.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re following me on any social media then you’ve probably seen some crude drawings. While I admit I’m doing them for my own enjoyment - and challenge - I should push towards something tangible.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Read 100 Books.

You’ll want to keep coming back an skimming over the table of contents months after you read it just to ensure you’re still folling the advice. Sometimes you’ll be doing things right; sometimes you’re far off the mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;establish-a-creative-process&quot;&gt;Establish a Creative Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core idea of the book is know what you want, plan how to get there and then execute it - without excuses.
Like most advise, it sounds easy until you have to start making changes in your life. David goes over pit falls to avoid while on the way; some he’s walked into himself. That doesn’t just mean “do what your told” either. From the text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Your process and your goals should align. The chief way in which you will evaluate the efficacy of your process is by judging how well it moves you forward towards you goals. A process that doesn’t deliver sufficient outputs, or delivers outputs other than those which are desired, must be revised.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be active about monitoring your own process for faults. For years, I would take online classes and feel that I wasn’t making any progres towards my goal of being a Data Scientist. Even know I recognized the topics and ideas in videos and articles, I never felt like was moving anywhere. Then, I did the work of starting to document all the classes I finished - was working on; or planned to work on - to find that I was actually making lots of progress in most of the important subjects necessary. This has now lead me to the next hurdle in the process: Application. I’ve redesign my methods and attention to build more and play more with the ideas I see in classes. In effect, watching lectures allows one to know more than others but not show anything for it. Which false into another part from the text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Practice zombies are focusing on doing things that are easy, rather than things that are hard - things which will move them forward and create growth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching online lectures is easy; building projects to show others is hard.
While I have some projects to show, they are far fewer than how much I want to have built.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">If you’re looking for a crash course in getting the creative process right then this is the correct book to read.

There are healthy and helpful tips for writing and about writing learned from reading the Pulps of the past - and as someone that hasn’t read much of them and slowly breaking that particular seal I cannot agree more. However, reading the book feels more like what my own essays in high school felt like with repetition spread around and re-wordings of the same ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That isn’t to say don’t purchase or read it; I think you should just because there is some good history here. The author’s knowledge about such topics as the speech &lt;em&gt;Mutation or Death&lt;/em&gt; was quite a surprise and the relationship between &lt;strong&gt;Old Pub&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;New Pub&lt;/strong&gt; is a meaningful distinction that Cowan does well. Personally, I think he’s overselling it as there is enough poor writing on display via Amazon Unlimited or niches such as LitRPG where the divide between practiced writers or amateurs shows up from the first page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, spend the money but get it in digital.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This book is about something worth noticing as the access to writing and publishing has broadened.
